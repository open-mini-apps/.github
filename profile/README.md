# Open Mini Apps

With the advancement of web technologies, mini-apps have become an integral part of not only native applications but
also other web applications. However, despite the widespread adoption of this approach—embedding web applications within
native clients—there remains a common challenge in understanding the implementation of such platforms, leading to
entirely custom solutions.

The mission of Open Mini Apps is to provide a set of documentation, terminology, and libraries to improve the
understanding of how mini-app platforms should be implemented, avoiding well-known pitfalls. In turn, this will not only
allow developer-users to predict the behavior of mini-app platforms and simplify mini apps' development, but also
simplify platform development for their creators.
